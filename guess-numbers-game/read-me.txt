This is a simple command line game. The game goes like this:
 
1. The game will think of 3 digit number that has no repeating digits.
2. You will then guess a 3 digit number
3. The game will then give back clues, the possible clues are:
     Hint: You've guessed X number(s) correctly and Y number(s) in the correct position.
     Match: You've guessed a correct number in the correct position    
4. Based on these clues you will guess again until you break the code with a
    perfect match!
